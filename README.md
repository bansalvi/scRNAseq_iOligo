# Single-cell Transcriptomic Changes in Oligodendrocytes Derived from Parkinson’s Disease Patient-iPSCs

This repository contains scripts and data analysis related to the study "Single-cell transcriptomic changes in oligodendrocytes and precursors derived from Parkinson’s disease patient-iPSCs with LRRK2-G2019S mutation". The study investigates the molecular changes in oligodendroglial lineage cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with the LRRK2-G2019S mutation.

# Overview
Despite extensive research, the contribution of the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation to Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study explores the impact of this mutation on oligodendroglial lineage cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identifies significant transcriptomic changes.
